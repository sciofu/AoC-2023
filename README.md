# AoC-2023
Solving Advent of Code 2023 🏝️

Trying to learn some Rust while solving programming challenges. In src there's then `main.rs` file will import modules, each challenge has its own module.
In each module there will be exported two functions (`solve_x()`) that will be returning the answer for each part of the challenge.
